# yuki

Yuki is the (planned) member cache abstraction for Beemo. The goal with Yuki is to be a thought experiment in designing a Java library with proper abstractions, though its main purpose will be to publicly showcase some of Beemo's workings and provide the utility to others who might need a similar solution.
